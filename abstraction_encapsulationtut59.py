Encapsulation is used to restrict access to methods and variables.
In encapsulation, code and data are wrapped together within a single unit from being modified by accident.

Data Abstraction
Data abstraction and encapsulation are synonymous as data abstraction is achieved through encapsulation.

Abstraction is used to hide internal details and show only functionalities. 
Abstracting something means to give names to things,
 so that the name captures the basic idea of what a function or a whole program does.
