"""Introspection is an ability to determine the type of an object at runtime.
Everything in python is an object. Every object in Python may have attributes and methods.
By using introspection, we can dynamically examine python objects. Code Introspection is used
for examining the classes, methods, objects, modules, keywords and get
information about them so that we can utilize it.
